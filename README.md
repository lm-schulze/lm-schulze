# Hi there, I'm Laura Schulze!

I'm currently a Master's student in the "Physics of Data" program at the Università degli studi di Padova.

## About Me

- 🎓 **Education:** Master’s in Physics of Data, Università degli studi di Padova
- 🧪 **Focus Areas:** Scientific computing, data analysis, data visualization, interdisciplinary physics
- 🐍 **Coding:** Primarily Python, with some experience in R and minor experience in Julia, C++ and Matlab
- 🌐 **Interests:** Complex Networks and their diverse real-world applications

## Projects
- [**Car make classification and verification using Snapshot Ensembling**](https://github.com/lm-schulze/NNDL_project_Cars) Final project for the course *Neural Networks and Deep Learning*. We train a model for car make classification and verification based on images from the CompCars dataset and use snapshot ensembling to improve performance without incurring additional training cost.
- [**Transformers: Analysing the transformation of token representations in different layers of GPT-2**](https://github.com/savinats/LCPb-Project). Final project for the course *Laboratory of Computational Physics Module B*. We analyse token representations extracted at different layers of the GPT-2 model in terms of their intrinsic dimension and pairwise distances. Additionally, we explore the effect of different parameters on the token probabilities after the last model layer.
