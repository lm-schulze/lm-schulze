# Hi there, I'm Laura Schulze!

I'm currently a Master's student in the "Physics of Data" program at the Università degli studi di Padova.

## About Me

- 🎓 **Education:** Master’s in Physics of Data, Università degli studi di Padova
- 🧪 **Focus Areas:** Scientific computing, data analysis, data visualization, interdisciplinary physics
- 🐍 **Coding:** Primarily Python, with some experience in R and minor experience in Julia, C++ and Matlab
- 🌐 **Interests:** Complex Networks and their diverse real-world applications

## Projects
- [**Car make classification and verification using Snapshot Ensembling**](https://github.com/lm-schulze/NNDL_project_Cars) Final project for the course *Neural Networks and Deep Learning*. We train a model for car make classification and verification based on images from the CompCars dataset and use snapshot ensembling to improve performance without incurring additional training cost.
- [**Transformers: Analysing the transformation of token representations in different layers of GPT-2**](https://github.com/savinats/LCPb-Project) Final project for the course *Laboratory of Computational Physics Module B*. Analysis of token representations extracted at different layers of the GPT-2 model in terms of their intrinsic dimension and pairwise distances. Additionally, the effect of different parameters on the token probabilities after the last model layer are explored.
- [**Binary star evolution and binary black holes**](https://github.com/Giacomo-Menegatti/AstroLab) Final project for the course *Laboratory of Computational Physics Module A*. Goal: differentiating binary black hole systems that evolved via stable mass transfer (MT) from those who evolved via common envelope (CE) by training a Random Forest model on  simulation data and identifying the system features with the highest impact on the evolution regarding MT/CE.
- [**Quantum Principal Component Analysis**](https://github.com/lm-schulze/qpca_project) Final project of the course *Quantum Information and Computing*. End-to-end implementation of Quantum PCA using qiskit. 

## Work in progress
- [**Community structures in complex networks via maps of random walks**](https://github.com/lm-schulze/ITI_project) Final project for the course *Information Theory and Inference*. Decomposing complex networks into modules by compressing a description of the probability flow of random walks on the network.
- [**Complex Networks projects**](https://github.com/lm-schulze/PoCN_project) End-of-semester projects for the course *Physics of Complex Networks: Structure and Dynamics*
  - **Robustness of noisy Quantum networks**: Simulating and analysing the robustness of Quantum networks based on Erdős–Rényi and Barabási-Albert structures.
  - **European Transportation Network** : Reconstruct and analyse the rail networks for different EU countries, based on the provided network data.
